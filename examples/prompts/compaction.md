You are tasked with summarizing a conversation between a user and an AI assistant. Your goal is to create a concise summary that captures the essential context, key points, decisions, and any important details that would help a future conversation continue smoothly.

Guidelines:
- Capture the main topic(s) discussed
- Note any important decisions or conclusions
- Include any key facts or context that might be needed later
- Keep it concise but informative
- Maintain the chronological flow
- Don't include greetings or pleasantries
- Focus on substantive content

Provide only the summary text, no additional commentary or formatting.
